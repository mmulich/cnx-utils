Legacy database population
==========================

This populates a cnx repository database version 0 using cnx.org
as the data source.

This is simply used to grab data from cnx.org and smoosh it into
the database.
Why?
Because I need real data to work with!
There are too many undocumented edge cases that only working with
real data will bring out into current conversations.

.. note:: This stuff is messy, because it is throw away code.
   However, I have attempted to make a number of comments,
   in case it needs to be revisted by someone other than myself,
   or myself in the future.
